# altEnv
altEnv is an Alternate Environment manager

This repo project is inspired by there being some strange environments that come up in CTF challenges. The idea here is to simplify the process of setting up these environemnts. Normally, one would just use VMWare or something, but when faced with an ARM/MIPS or other strange binary, it becomes a little more complicated. The goal of this script is simply to take that complexity away from the challenges, and allow you to work on the challenge.
